This is just the beginning, but it gives us a foundation for parsing SOM expressions into an AST. Next steps would be:

1. Complete the implementation of all expression types (assignments, blocks, etc.)
2. Implement the AST printer for debugging
3. Generate bytecode from the AST
4. Update the VM to execute all bytecode types
